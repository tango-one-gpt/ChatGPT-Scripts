As a set of reference points, here are some iconic examples of the look we want to emulate:

	The Stardust Resort and Casino in Las Vegas: Although it was demolished in 2007, the Stardust was an iconic example of Googie architecture. Its famous sign and façade embodied the space-age elements typical of the style.

	Norms Restaurants: A chain of diners in Los Angeles, Norms Restaurants feature the Googie style's distinctive design elements, such as dramatic rooflines, neon signs, and use of glass.

	The Seattle Space Needle: Built for the 1962 World's Fair, the Space Needle is a landmark of the Pacific Northwest and embodies the space-age enthusiasm of the era.

	Johnie's Coffee Shop: Located in Los Angeles, this classic diner (now closed but preserved as a historic landmark) is another quintessential example of Googie architecture, with its distinctive roofline and signage.

	The Encounter Restaurant at LAX: Another example at the Los Angeles International Airport, this restaurant was located inside the Theme Building and featured an interior that complemented the building's space-age exterior.
