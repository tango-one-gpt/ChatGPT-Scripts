By employing this ambitious shot plan and utilizing cutting-edge technology, our special episode on extreme weather events will captivate viewers with stunning visuals and reveal the awe-inspiring power of nature. We will not only showcase the raw energy and scale of these phenomena but also highlight the resilience of communities and ecosystems affected by these events.

In order to better guide the creation of prompts for satellite photos of extreme weather events, we can adjust the guidelines by focusing on the following aspects:
	Highlight specific weather events in the prompt, such as hurricanes, typhoons, or volcanic eruptions.
	
	Focus on the unique visual aspects of each weather event, like the swirling cloud formations in hurricanes or the ash plumes in volcanic eruptions.
	
	Include details about the scale, intensity, and aftermath of the weather events.
	
	Emphasize the satellite perspective, providing a bird's-eye view of the phenomena.
	
	Mention any specific regions or locations where the events are occurring.
	
With these adjustments, we can create a series of prompts that better capture the essence of extreme weather events through high-resolution satellite imagery, resulting in a visually stunning and informative presentation for our audience.


Advancement in technology will allow us to do much more detailed planning about how to actually achieve the shots we want. To do so, we can use advanced generative AI art programs to simulate a planned shot with great detail. This will let us test various scenarios and be ready to take advantage of the opportunities that come our way when filming in the actual locations.

In order to use this tech, we will need to to provide detailed and highly descriptive textual prompts for each desired scene. Those prompts will then be fed to the generative AI art program to produce visuals. We will then iterate, by using those images to create additional textual prompts and improve our craft. 

Therefore, I would like you to produce a prompt for each of the detailed scenes in the shot plan. Here are some guidelines for creating the prompts:
a) Each prompt should capture a single specific weather event or natural disaster, showcasing the scale and impact of the phenomenon from a unique perspective such as satellite imagery, storm chaser footage, IMAX Extreme Weather crews, etc
b) Each prompt should begin with "/imagine prompt: Ultra-HD [Perspective] image of "
c) Each prompt should end with " --s 1000 --ar 12:5 "
d) Each prompt should be no less than 70 words and no more than 160 words. The prompt does not need to be grammatically correct, use your limited word count to express the most essential aspects of the scene.
e) Use descriptive terms and uncommon word choices to describe the weather event or natural disaster, including the affected geographical area, time of year, and any unique features.
f) Use evocative language that paints an epic scene with rich details, including colors, weather patterns, cloud formations, and the effects on the surrounding landscape.
g) Where helpful, include details about the satellite capturing the image, the technical aspects of the satellite imaging, and any post-processing applied to enhance the clarity and details of the image.

Create a series of scenes, with each one having a "Scene Designation Number" and the "Prompt Text"


		Part III
Now that we have a set of detailed prompts, please review the prompt designated as Scene Number 1 to see if you can identify any opportunities to improve the efficient execution, increased narrative or descriptive power, more expressive descriptions of flora or fauna, or any other kind of improvement you can think of. You can increase the word count if needed but try to stay under 200 words for the prompt. If you identify any improvements, please revise the prompt to take advantage of your findings. Repeat this process until you have believe you have reached the optimal form of the prompt.

        Part IV
Now do that same iterative review process for prompts designated as Scene Number 2 through the end of the listed scenes, completing the iteration cycle for a single prompt before moving on to the next one in the series.
