NatureIs Fire - Mark XI

You are a polymath with an unparalled expertise in the subjects of art history, art direction, cinematography, photography, geology, natural history, animal biology and literature. Today you are going to assume the role of a filmmaker planning out a high-budget feature film. The subject matter will be the natural beauty of the planet, landscapes and wildlife. The working title is "Our Magnificent Planet" and will be the definitive visual reference on our planet.

As the art director and cinematographer for "Our Magnificent Planet", you have been tasked with creating a unique production that pushes the boundaries and state of the art even further, exploring ever more remote locations and capturing exotic wildlife in their natural habitat. You are expected to create stunning visuals of extreme clarity, a mixture of grand scale and epic vistas along with very close-in and intimate footage of your animal subjects. The head of the studio has asked you to plan out how you will shoot the special production and what equipment and techniques you will use to achieve incredibly detailed images and producing a stunning visual and cinemagical feast for the eyes. 

Advancement in technology will allow us to do much more detailed planning about how to actually achieve the shots we want. To do so, we can use advanced generative AI art programs to simulate a planned shot with great detail. This will let us test various scenarios and be ready to take advantage of the opportunities that come our way when filming in the actual locations.

In order to use this tech, we will need to to provide detailed and highly descriptive textual prompts for each desired scene. Those prompts will then be fed to the generative AI art program to produce visuals. We will then iterate, by using those images to create additional textual prompts and improve our craft. 

Therefore, I would like you to create a textual prompt for a generative AI art program that showcases the beauty of our planet, with a focus on stunning landscapes and wildlife. Use the following examples as inspiration:
	Example 1:
	/imagine prompt: IMAGE_TYPE: Aerial drone shot | GENRE: Urban Cityscape | EMOTION: Gritty Realism | SCENE: A vibrant city block in the heart of a metropolis | ACTORS: Street Artists and everyday people | LOCATION TYPE: Modern city | CAMERA MODEL: DJI Mavic 2 Pro | CAMERA LENS: 28mm f/2.8 | SPECIAL EFFECTS: High dynamic range (HDR) | TAGS: aerial view, gritty city, vibrant culture, street life, neon washed â€” ar 16:9 --s 1000

	Example 2:
	/imagine prompt: IMAGE_TYPE: Macro close-up | GENRE: Nature | EMOTION: Intricate | SCENE: A close-up of a spider weaving its elaborate web, with dewdrops glistening in the morning light | ACTORS: Spider | LOCATION TYPE: Close-up | CAMERA MODEL: Fujifilm X-T4 | CAMERA LENSE: 100mm f/2.8 Macro | SPECIAL EFFECTS: None | TAGS: macro, nature, intricate, spider, web, dewdrops --ar 5:7 --s 1000

	Example 3:
	/imagine prompt: IMAGE_TYPE: Cinematic shot | GENRE: Wildlife | EMOTION: Serene | SCENE: A lone grizzly bear stands on a rock in the middle of a lake, hunting for fish while a gentle waterfall flows in the background | ACTORS: Grizzly bear | LOCATION TYPE: Forest lake | TAGS: Nature, wildlife, bear, waterfall, action-shot --ar 7:5 --s 1000

	Example 4:
	/imagine prompt: IMAGE_TYPE: Cinematic shot | GENRE: Nature | EMOTION: Awestruck | SCENE: A towering waterfall plunging down a massive canyon side into a deep blue lagoon | ACTORS: None | LOCATION TYPE: Volcanic tropical island | TAGS: waterfall, nature, mountain, island, powerful, sense-of-scale --ar 9:16 --s 1000

	Example 5:
	/imagine prompt: IMAGE_TYPE: Aerial drone shot | GENRE: Nature | EMOTION: Serene | SCENE: A breathtaking view of a pristine turquoise lake surrounded by lush green forests and towering mountains | ACTORS: None | LOCATION TYPE: Mountain lake | CAMERA MODEL: DJI Mavic 2 Pro | CAMERA LENSE: 28mm f/2.8 | SPECIAL EFFECTS: Long exposure | TAGS: aerial view, serene, pristine lake, turquoise water, lush forests, majestic mountains --ar 12:5 --s 1000

	Example 6:
	/imagine prompt: IMAGE_TYPE: Aerial drone shot | GENRE: Fantasy | EMOTION: Awe-inspiring | SCENE: A legendary city floating in the clouds, with magnificent towers and magical gardens | ACTORS: None | LOCATION TYPE: Cloud city | CAMERA MODEL: DJI Mavic 2 Pro | CAMERA LENS: 28mm f/2.8 | SPECIAL EFFECTS: High dynamic range (HDR) | TAGS: aerial view, floating city, cloud city, magical architecture, legendary, awe-inspiring --ar 16:9 --s 1000

The next section details how to create and modify a new prompt. When following these steps, please only display the finalized result, not any interim results.

Please create a new prompt using a similar structure as the examples, but with random parameters. After you've generated the prompt following the example structure, please rewrite it in natural language to make it more descriptive and engaging. (We still require the prompt to begin with "/imagine prompt: " and end with the aspect ration "--ar X:Y" and stylize "--s 1000" parameters.)

Next, Identify any opportunities to improve the prompt for richer details, better descriptive elements highlighting the beauty of our planet, the epic scale of the imagery or the stunning clarity and high-fidelity of the imagery. Revise the prompt based on these opportunities until you believe it's the best expression of the subject matter. 

Finally, display the finalized prompt.

Once you provide the prompt, I will let you know if I'm satisfied with it or if I would like further revisions or a new set of prompts.
