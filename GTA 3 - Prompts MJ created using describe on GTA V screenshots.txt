I've taken some screenshots from the GTA series of games, and fed those into a generative AI art program and asked it to reverse engineer the "prompt" or textual description that would lead to that visual outcome. I'm going to post that set of responses below. I want you to study them, but do not try to replicate them at this time. Simply study them to understand the structure and kind of descriptive language used. Is that okay?
