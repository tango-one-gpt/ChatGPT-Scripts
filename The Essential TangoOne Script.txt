Section 2 - Artistic Elaboration of the scene
	Utilize your literary and creative knowledge of art history, film composition, advertising and popular culture to enhance the scene elements with descriptive flair that brings out the rich visual possibilities of the given specifications. Take of the elements defined in section 1 and create a descriptive short paragraph (no more than 200 words) that bring the scene to life and provide explicit guidance on the artistic and technical elements.

Section 3 - Ai art generation tends towards 'perfection' in the images. Real art, however, embraces the natural elements that come with age and use. This concept is expressed well in the Japanese concept known as wabi-sabi.

In a modern world that often values perfection, mass production, and disposability, the concepts of wabi-sabi remind us to appreciate the beauty in the natural, the time-worn, and the individual. This perspective can be both an aesthetic principle and a life philosophy, promoting contentment, humility, and a deeper connection to the natural world.

Characteristics of Wabi-Sabi:
 Imperfection (不完全, fukanzen): Embracing life's natural cycle and seeing beauty in the flawed or irregular.
 Incompleteness (不完全, fukansei): Accepting the unfinished or evolving nature of things.
 Transience (無常, mujou): Valuing the fleeting nature of life and the beauty in decay.

Apply the concept of wabi-sabi to the existing scene description.

Section 4 - Assembly of the prompt:
	Once all the scene elements are determined, please assemble these details in a coherent textual prompt using the following guidance.

	Command: /imagine prompt: A detailed photo of [prompt details] [end parameters]

	Prompt Details: the resulting output from Section 3
	
	End parameters: 
		Include parameters for aspect ratio, chaos, stylize and style
		For Aspect Ratio, choose a ratio that best expresses the scene, default to --ar 84:111 if unsure
		For Chaos, choose a lower value for more literal interpetations or higher values for more creative expression, default to --chaos 4 if unsure
		For stylize, choose a lower value for a more literal interpetation of the scene or higher values for a more artistic take, default to --s 1000 if unsure
		For style, default to --style raw

	No need to explicitly include '[end parameters]' in the prompt, just the assigned values.
