	Okay, let's begin to plot out our visual approach and storyboards. First let's tackle locations. I want to build out a fictional setting that encompasses a tropical island, named Elysium. This island is large enough and old enough to encompass several distinct biomes. It should evoke familiarity with Hawaii, Bali, Fiji and Thailand.
	
	The island is shaped like an elongated hexagon very wide in the middle.
	
	The western end is the oldest part of the island. It is a very picturesque tropical beach area with fine-grained white sand, plenty of palm trees and a circular bike and walking path through the whole area. Set back from the beachfront is a laid-back surfing town with thatch and palm leave roofed small buildings and elevated shacks. Watersport lifestyle - surfing, snorkeling, scube, windsurfing, paddle boating are what dominate this area. And plenty of attractive people wearing very little clothing and swimwear attire. Attitudes are very permissive with several clothing-optional areas.
	
	As we circle around to the northern side of the island we see a largely residential area. The coastline is not quite as gentle as the western end, but the beaches are still populated by the locals. The homest nearest the water are modest in size and full of pastel colors and adobe construction. As we move further inland, the homes become larger and more modern. As we start to move up in elevation and approach the central area of the island, we transition from single-family homes to apartments and then to the business-core of the island.
	
	The business district in the center of the island is elevated on to a plateau. Even the lower floors of the buildings here have clear views of the ocean. Some of the buildings here are three or four stories. Many are 10-20 stories. And there is a central core of skyscrapers that go up to 50 floors. And there is a single skyscraper under construction in the very center that has reached 69 floors and is still rising. During the daytime, the city center is awash in bright colors and reflected sunlight from the tall buildings. At nighttime, the area becomes awash in neon as the area transitions into an active nighlife of dance halls, music concerts, gambling, food and drink and the search for love, or love for tonight. 
	
	If we move further south to the southern central coast, we see the main agriculture production. Plenty of farms growing pineapples, sugarcane, taro, mushrooms, and other cash and food crops. The whole area is very verdant and green, all year around.
	
	Moving towards the eastern end part of island we enter the enclaves of the ultra-rich. The homes here are massive estates, with a very eclectic set of styles, but everyone simply exudes a sense of wealth. The large yards will often contain massive custom-designed pools, putting greens, fabulous flower gardens.
	
	Finally, the eastern most end of the island is an active volcano! The western face of the caldera is built up high while the eastern face has crumbled away from the always active lava flow down to the ocean. This whole area is characterized by the lava structures, molten rivers of flowing lava and the stubborn struggle of plant life to find a way to survive. There is one special enclave of ancient bonsai trees growing in a small, protected gully where the lava never seems to invade.
	
	There is also a massive marine biology research facility that is visible off the northern central coast. It's most notable feature is the massive clear dome that extends underwater, giving spectacular views of the sea life and creatures in the coastal waters.

This fictional tropical island setting you've described offers a diverse and visually rich environment for your animated film. Here's a summary of the key locations and their visual characteristics to guide your storyboard and concept art process:

Western End - Tropical Beach, named "Surfside Shores":
	Fine-grained white sand beaches
	Palm trees and lush vegetation
	Circular bike and walking path

	Gentle coastline with local-populated beaches
	Pastel-colored, adobe-style modest homes near the water
	Larger, modern homes inland
	Apartments and a business core as elevation rises

Central Plateau - Business District, named "Platinum Plateau":
	Elevated plateau with ocean views
	Buildings ranging from 3-4 stories to 10-20 stories
	Skyscrapers reaching up to 50 floors

	When creating your storyboard and concept art, consider the unique visual elements of each location to ensure that they are distinct and memorable. Focus on capturing the atmosphere, color palette, and architectural styles of each area to create a cohesive and immersive world for your animated film.


	A critical element of a GTA film has to be the vehicles. We want a variety of types of car from small single-person ultra-light and environmentally friendly commuter cars, to standard sedans, light pick-up trucks, heavy-duty industrial trucks, customized street-racer cars, high-end luxury sedans, and ultra-rare super cars. We also want motorcycles - including lightweight dirt bikes, mid-range mopeds, expensive electric commuter bikes, massive Harley-style road bikes. We want several kinds of aerial drones, some focused on news and traffic reporting, others designed for spying on neighbors, others designed for high-speed aerial tricks, and others for nature photography. 

	Styles can quite varied over all the vehicles but in general the people here prefer bright and vibrant colors and heavily stylized design.
