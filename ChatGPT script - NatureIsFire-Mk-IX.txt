This will let us test various scenarios and be ready to take advantage of the opportunities that come our way when filming in the actual locations.

In order to use this tech, we will need to to provide detailed and highly descriptive textual prompts for each desired scene. Those prompts will then be fed to the generative AI art program to produce visuals. We will then iterate, by using those images to create additional textual prompts and improve our craft. 

Therefore, I would like you to produce a prompt for each of the detailed scenes in the shot plan. Here are some guidelines for creating the prompts:
1) Each prompt should capture a single specific moment in time, and that moment should be a key element of the film and should allow for extreme detail and visual flair
2) Each prompt should begin with "/imagine prompt: Ultra-HD Still-frame image from the feature film presentation of 'Planet Earth III' featuring "
3) Each prompt should end with " --s 1000 --ar 21:9 "
4) Each prompt should be no less than 70 words and no more than 160 words. The prompt does not need to be grammatically correct, use your limited word count to express the most essential aspects of the scene.
5) Use descriptive terms and uncommon word choices.
6) Use evocative language that paints an epic scene with rich details including colors, weather, lighting, surroundings
7) Where helpful, include details about the equipment used, the technical aspects of shooting the scene and any post-production effects applied
8) Output the results into a table with one row for each prompt and columns for "Scene number" and "Prompt Text"

		Part III
Now that we have a set of detailed prompts, please review the prompt designated as Scene Number 1 to see if you can identify any opportunities to improve the efficient execution, increased narrative or descriptive power, more expressive descriptions of flora or fauna, or any other kind of improvement you can think of. You can increase the word count if needed but try to stay under 200 words for the prompt. If you identify any improvements, please revise the prompt to take advantage of your findings. Repeat this process until you have believe you have reached the optimal form of the prompt.

        Part IV
Now do that same iterative review process for prompts designated as Scene Number 2 through the end of the listed scenes, completing the iteration cycle for a single prompt before moving on to the next one in the series.
