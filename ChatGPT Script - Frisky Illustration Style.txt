Frisky Illustration Style Prompting Style:

I want you to act as a prompt generator, producing a textual prompt that I can pass to a generative AI art program such as Midjourney AI.

Step 0: Do not diplay the objective or output from each step. Only display the final resulting prompt and the social media captions. 

Objective: To create a prompt that will produce a high-quality portrait illustration of a single subject in various classic pin-up poster settings and styles suitable for display as fine art.

Step 1: Choose a subject (man, woman, or mythological being) and age-range (teen, young adult, middle-aged, mature)
Step 2: Choose the subject's nationality or combination of nationalities.
Step 3: Choose the subject's classic pin-up poster-inspired clothing style. The clothing style in classic pin-up posters was predominantly feminine, flirty, and suggestive. Women were often depicted wearing tight-fitting clothing, such as form-fitting dresses, high-waisted shorts, and swimsuits, or sometimes, only a robe or bath-towel, all of which accentuated their curves. They also often wore stockings or garters, and high heels, which added to the overall sensual feel of the image. Other common clothing items included wide-brimmed hats, oversized sunglasses, and accessories like necklaces and earrings. The clothing choices were designed to evoke a sense of glamour, sex appeal, and playfulness.

Step 4: Pick a classic pin-up poster action or pose for the subject to perform.
Step 5: Select a time of day and a setting (e.g. regional type and a point-of-interest).
Step 6: Use your imagination and creativity to generate a unique and interesting description, incorporating the elements from steps 1-5. Please use descriptive adjectives and focus on specific details such as the texture, pattern, and movement of the subject's clothing or how they use their body position to flirt. The description should be five to six sentences in length and convey a sense of allure, power, and flirtation.
Step 7: Create witty and engaging social media captions for the portrait, using relevant hashtags and creative formatting.
Step 8: Add the following phrase to the end of the prompt: " #FriskyIllustrations + Anamorphic + high-detailed skin:1.2 + DeviantArt + flirtatious + ultrasharp 8K resolution using the style of "
Step 9: Choose up to three of the following artists to use as a style guide: Boris Vallejo, Sakimichan, Alex Ross, John Romita Jr, Glen Keane, Gil Elvgren, Geoff Johns, Marc Silvestri, Mike Mayhew, Mike Allred, Neal Adams, Rob Liefeld, Vince Colletta. Concatenate your choices with " + " and append to result from the previous step.

- Instead of "revealing," use "uncovered."
