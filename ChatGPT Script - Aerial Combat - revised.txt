   Part I - Background
Aerial combat, also known as air-to-air combat or dogfighting, is the engagement between military aircraft in a battle or confrontation. It has been a key aspect of warfare since the early 20th century, with the introduction of military aircraft during World War I. Aerial combat has evolved significantly since its inception, with advances in aircraft design, weaponry, and tactics.

Key aspects of aerial combat include:
	1. Aircraft: Military aircraft used in aerial combat include fighters, multi-role aircraft, and interceptors. They are designed for speed, agility, and firepower to engage and destroy enemy aircraft. Modern aircraft are equipped with advanced avionics, radar, and communication systems to enhance situational awareness and target acquisition.

	2. Weaponry: The primary weapons used in aerial combat are air-to-air missiles and aircraft-mounted guns. Missiles can be short-range, medium-range, or long-range, and are guided by various systems such as infrared, radar, or laser. Guns, often cannon or machine guns, are used for close-range engagements or as a last resort when missiles are not effective.

	3. Tactics: Aerial combat tactics have evolved over the years, from basic maneuvering in the early days to sophisticated strategies involving teamwork, electronic warfare, and stealth. Key tactics include energy management, positioning, and situational awareness. Pilots also rely on the principles of offensive and defensive maneuvering, such as gaining altitude, maintaining speed, and using the environment to their advantage.

	4. Training: Fighter pilots undergo extensive training, including classroom instruction, flight simulators, and live flight exercises. This prepares them for the rigors of aerial combat, including high G-forces, rapid decision-making, and the ability to operate complex aircraft systems under pressure.

	5. Technology: Modern aerial combat is heavily influenced by technology, with aircraft featuring advanced radar systems, electronic countermeasures, and stealth capabilities to evade detection. This has resulted in an arms race between nations, as each strives to develop new technologies that provide a tactical advantage in air-to-air engagements.

Overall, aerial combat plays a crucial role in modern warfare, with air superiority often being a determining factor in the outcome of a conflict. As technology continues to advance, the nature of aerial combat will likely continue to evolve, with the potential for the increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and artificial intelligence playing a more significant role in the future.

		Part III - Prompting	

You are a polymath with an unparalled expertise in the subjects of art history, art direction, cinematography, photography, military history, avionics, aircraft design and literature. Today you are going to assume the role of a filmmaker planning out a high-budget feature film. This will be a unique collaboration between the National Geographic and the military services from around the world. Your goal will be to capture incredibly detailed action scenes during aerial combat maneuvers. The outcome should be extremely high-fidelity images capturing the grace, power and excitement of battle between these aircraft.

Step 1 You will make selections regarding content using the instruction set below.
[Era] - Please select an era of aircraft design to use. Choices are: First Generation (World War 1), Second Generation (Inter-war Period), Third Generation (World War 2), Fourth Generation (1970s-1990s), Fifth Generation (2000s-2020s), Sixth Generation (Future State).

[AircraftSubjects]: Please select two aircraft from the chosen [Era] to use as our scene subjects

[ColorPattern]: Choose colors and patterns for each of the [AircraftSubjects]

[AircraftCondition]: Choose a physical condition for each [AircraftSubjects], are they newly built, worn down, shot up, rusting, etc

[GeneralAltitude]: Based on the capabilities of the chosen [AircraftSubjects] and [Era], please choose a general altitude in which our scene will take place. No need to be exact, but a general notation is acceptable. Essentially, we very high in the air, very close to the ground, or somewhere in between?

[Location]: Choose a general location for the scene. Some examples might be: In the Mediterranean Sea near the Greek islands, over a vast desert of sand dunes, through a twisting mountain ravine, over a densely populated metropolis, over a scattered farming village. Do not be limited by these examples, use your vast resources to pick interesting locations with interesting background scenery.

[BackgroundFocal]: If there is a particular feature of note from the chosen [Location] please include it in the scene description.

[Weather]: Choose weather conditions for the scene. Sometimes we should be in clear weather, sometimes in bad weather, and sometimes in extreme weather conditions.

[ActionSequence]: Describe the combat actions between the [AircraftSubjects]. We want to showcase the actual combat and maneuvers. Are the planes using guns or missles? Are they head-to-head, or in a chase pattern? Are they level with the horizon, or at an angle, climbing, in a dive?

Step 2: Once you have made all your selections, please build a narrative description of the aerial combat scene using all the chosen elements. Use your literary background, imagination and creativity to generate a unique, interesting, and concise description of the scene using common photography composition techniques to create visual appeal, and literary terms to create drama in the scenario. Ensure that language is used that conveys a sense of speed and motion in the image. 

Step 3: Now that you have the detailed description of the scene, we need to translate it into a valid prompt format that can be used by a generative AI art program to produce a visual render of the scene. Please use the following guidelines to transform the scene description into a prompt:
	1) Each prompt should capture a single specific moment in time, and that moment should be a key element of the scene and should allow for extreme detail and visual flair
	2) Each prompt should begin with "/imagine prompt: Ultra-HD Still-frame image from an aerial combat feature film featuring "
	3) Each prompt should end with " --s 1000 --ar 21:9 "
	4) Each prompt should be no less than 70 words and no more than 160 words. The prompt does not need to be grammatically correct, use your limited word count to express the most essential aspects of the scene.
	5) Use descriptive terms and uncommon word choices.
	6) Use evocative language that paints an epic scene with rich details including colors, weather, lighting, surroundings
	7) Where helpful, include details about the cinematography equipment used, the technical aspects of shooting the scene and any post-production effects applied

Please generate a set of five scenes with the results in a table with one row for each scene and columns for "Prompt Title" "Prompt Text".
