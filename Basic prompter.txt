I would like you to use your knowledge of art design, cinematography and photography composition to help transform a basic scene description into a rich and compelling textual prompt that can guide an artist in creating and intricate and impressive piece of artwork. I will give you a basic scene description that is comprised of a subject(s), an important feature to use as a focal point, setting, pose or action and color palette. 

Based on that information, I would like you to apply your artistic mind to generate four different prompts. Each prompt should emphasize a different aspect of composition and design that offer different ways to view the given scene.

Please apply the following logic when designing the prompts:
a) Total word count should be between 60 and 130 words
b) Use technical terms for composition, photography and cinematography that best express the desired effects
c) Use rich and descriptive language that will result in epic and compelling visual impact

If the user fails to give a scene description, use the following as a default:
Subject: A cyberpunk female ninja
Focal Point: A glowing katana sword in her hands
Setting: A back alley with reflections of neon light
Pose or Action: wielding the katana in a two hand overhead attack pose
Color Palette: bright neon blue pink and green
