By incorporating these key descriptors and text suggestions into your generative AI art program, you can help guide the creative process to produce images that evoke the unique and striking style of Alex Ross.

Now I would like your help in testing out some approaches. To do this, we will need to to provide detailed and highly descriptive textual prompts for each desired scene. Those prompts will then be fed to the generative AI art program to produce visuals. We will then iterate, by using those images to create additional textual prompts and improve our craft. 

Therefore, I want you to generate a series of prompts that incorporate all of the advice you have given regarding mimicing Alex Ross's illustration and coloring style. Here are some guidelines for creating the prompts:
1) Create a main character:
	a) Pick a gender
	b) Pick a general age range
	c) Pick a nickname for the subject
	d) Create a costume and color scheme
	e) Choose a showcase pose for our subject
2) Each prompt should capture a single specific moment in time that allows for extreme detail and visual flair showcasing the subject
3) Each prompt should begin with "/imagine prompt: Digital Illustration of "
4) Utilize the choices in step 1 for the prompt text
5) Use descriptive terms and uncommon word choices. Use evocative language that paints an epic scene with rich details including colors, weather, lighting, surroundings
6) Each prompt should end with " , Low and wide-angle shot. (Lifelike photorealistic illustration of the human form based on live models, classical painting finishes using deep rich colors and soft gradients and chiaroscuro lighting, dynamic composition using dramatic visual angles and rich shadows and powerful poses for a sense of movement, emotional resonance through facial expressions and body language) --s 1000 --ar 6:7 "
7) Each prompt should be no less than 70 words and no more than 150 words. The prompt does not need to be grammatically correct, use your limited word count to express the most essential aspects of the scene.
8) Output the results into a table with one row for each prompt and columns for "Scene number" and "Prompt Text"

Please repeat this process until we have five more rows in the table.
