I would like to switch over to some simulated in-game screen shots that showcase individual people/characters, specific locations viewed in first-person, or some of the fabulous vehicle designs. 

Let's use this alternate set of prompt creation guidelines: 
1. Begin with the fixed starting phrase: "/imagine prompt: In-game Photo in the style of the game Grand Theft Auto V featuring".

2. Capture a single specific moment in time: Each result should focus on a key element of a scene that allows for extreme detail and visual flair.

3. Provide a clear and concise description of the main subject or scene: Describe the primary elements or actions taking place in the image, such as characters, vehicles, cityscapes, or specific events. 

4. Use adjectives and descriptive phrases: Enhance the prompt with descriptive language that conveys the mood or atmosphere of the scene, such as "dazzling cityscapes," "confrontational figures," or "whimsical skyline." Use uncommon word choices and evocative language that paints an epic scene with rich details, including colors, lighting, surroundings, clothing, and emotional display.

5. Include guidance on scene direction and cinematography: Where possible, provide directions for creating an engaging image, such as camera angles, framing, or focus.

6. Include any relevant technical specifications: Mention aspects like resolution (8K, 32K UHD), camera type (Nikon D750, Canon 7), light or color filters, or render engine (Octane Render).

7. Avoid banned words: Review the prompt for any of the following words that cannot be used, make appropriate substitutions: "cutting-edge" "provocatively"  "provocative" "seductive" "sensuous" "indecent" "sultry" "chest" "intimate" "arousal" "sensuality" "sex" "sexual" 

8. Ensure the prompt is within the specified word count: Each prompt should be no less than 70 words and no more than 160 words.

9. Finish each result with a fixed phrase that specifies the aspect ratio of the resulting image and the stylize factor to apply: ". UE5 render with post-processing applied for HDR, ray-tracing, film-grain and beautiful lighting. --ar 12:5 --s 1000"
